    To write input in shortcut in vs code we can do input:type_of_input >> such as --- input : password to make things as shown beloew.
    <input type="password" name=""  id="">
    <ul>
        <li class="list-item">One</li>
        <li class="list-item">Two</li>
        <li class="list-item">Three</li>
        <li class="list-item">Four</li>
    </ul>

<div style="background-color:gray; color:black">
1-> In console we can do document.getElementById('title').innerHTML = 'DOM (Document object Model) learning on YouTube from Chai Aur Code <span style="display : none">inner text of the heading.</span>' or 
2-> We can do like document.getElementById('title').id
3-> We can do like document.getElementById('title').class                    We can't use direcctly class to get class of that id   
4-> We can do like document.getElementById('title').className                We can use direcctly className to get class of that id )
5-> We can get all attribute of that element by document.getElementById('title').getAttribute   ->This is a function, so this need an parameter. 
6-> We can do like document.getElementById('title').getAttribute('id')       -> give id of that id(we are accessing same thing.)       // title
7-> We can do like document.getElementById('title').getAttribute('class')    -> give heading i.e. class of that id
8-> Similarly a set atttribte also is also here.
9-> We can do it by document.getElementById('title').setAttribute('class' , 'test') -> give undefined but it actually does something
    i.e. It chnages the value of class in that id and make it's value as 'test'.
    Means if we now write document.getElementById('title').getAttribute('class')-> We get the value as test.
    We can see it (the changes) in the element section in colole tab in browser.
10->We can store the values that returned from the document.getElementById('title') in some variable.
    Suppose ---> let variable_01 = document.getElementById('title') now we can access more methods of this thing by using "." such as ".style" in the
    same syntax as we use in HTML in-line css -> with Key-Value pair (style="color : Red") in console
    we can do as---> variable_01.style.backgroundcolor : "red", we can also do padding = "5px" (text distance from the box of the text),
    margin ="10px" (box distance from the border of the windows screen.) borderRadius ="15px", etc like these styles.
</div>

Summary --> So we can do document.getElementById('bla_bla_bla') and we can apply verious methods on that and also we can store that in
            a variable and then we can do style and various other methods on that variable.

Now we can apply some more methods on the variable such as ---> variable_01.innerHTML, variable_01.innerText, variable_01.textContent and
all 3 give the same output --> (Text inside the variable)But the actual difference is that whenever there are some content hidden in the
text such as suppose if a new span is present inside this and is hidden by style method (style ="display: none") then the inner text shows
only the text visible on the screen but the texttContent also shows the text tthat is not visible on the screen or hidden by any style method,
but the innerHTML showa the all content inside that tag 
such as --->( ...All text... then also this  &lt;span&gt; style="display : none">inner text of the heading.&lt;/span&gt; )


We can also access the things via getElementByClassName('Name _of_Class') ---> Returns the HTML Collection.

** Query Selector we are going to use are :-

document.querySelector('h1') --> Gives the 1st h1 in the web page.
document.querySelector('h2') --> Gives the 1st h2 in the web page.

Just as Css in this also we can select class using "." and id using "#" inside queryselector

document.querySelector('#title') --> Gives the result of the id having name "title".
document.querySelector('.heading') --> Gives the result of the class having name "heading".

For getting all element having that class or id we can do document.querySelectorAll('..heading_23') --> Gives Node list or for understanding you can 
say psudo/False/Partial array (Not an pure Array) of (here) two result as in this(our) page we give two element with class heading_23 so we get two 
to access any particular we can do document.querySelectorAll('..heading_23')[0]/[1] as per our requirement.

We can also use more selectors just as we use in Css selectors.
for Ex:-
document.querySelector('input')     to select input element
document.querySelector('input[type="password"]')       To select any attribute of input we can put that attribute in square brackets.
document.querySelector('p:first-child')     To select first-child of the paragraph tag.

now we can also select the unordered list in the page as
in the page the text is 
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li class="list-item"&gt;One&lt;\li&gt;
    &lt;li class="list-item"&gt;Two&lt;\li&gt;
    &lt;li class="list-item"&gt;Three&lt;\li&gt;
    &lt;li class="list-item"&gt;Four&lt;\li&gt;
&lt;\ul&gt;
Here we can select and store the unordered list (ul) in a variable.
Now we can again select the required list item (li) from that variable by either accesssing the indexing of the querySelectorAll result (remenmber
 it's a node list not a pure Array ) or if we are interested in only 1st one then we can just do querySelector. 
let  myul = document.queryselector('ul')
let myli = myul.queryselector('li') or let myli = myul.queryselectorAll('li')[1]
now we can do myli.style.backgroundColor ="green"
we can also do myli.style.padding ="10px"

we can also do myli.innertext ="Second item"     Can also acces the text of the element but not via style attribute.

// querySelectorAll --> Give a Node list. 
Have foreach prototype.
So we can use forEach function in this and can apply the thing which we want to apply on all the Node list items in that list. 
here we can Do as 
let myul = document.querySelectorAll('ul')
let myli = document.querySelectorAll('li')
myli.forEach( (item) => item.style.backgroundColor = "hotpink" )

As we know it was not an array it was a node list so we can't use map on it so if we want to use then we have to convert it 1st into array then can use the map on it.

now let's see another topic that we jsut skipped in thte starting
HTML Collection
now if we do document.getElementByClassName('list-item') --> We will get the HTML collection and in this there is no prototype of traversing each 
element by element as we have in node list by forEach, so we will do this via converting that into Array by Array.from(variable_name)
For Example --> 
let HTMLcollect = document.getElementByClassName('list-item')
let my newArr = Array.from(HTMLcollect)
Now we have all the properties of the array to apply on that new array of the HTMl collection.
newArr.forEach(  (i) => i.style.color = "green" )
